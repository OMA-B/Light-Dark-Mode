# Light-Dark-Mode

This is a simple project to build my knowledge of light and dark mode...

Resources used:
--Scalable Vector Graphic(SVG) background patterns from Hero-Patterns
--fonts from Google Fonts
--Icons from FontAwesome 
--Scalable Vector Graphic(SVG) images from undraw.io

...use of LocalStorage was implemented to remember mode last switched to.

I've arranged the files and codes in such a way that you wouldn't find difficulty navigating through and understanding...

But if get muzzled at any point, you can always reach out to me on any of my social media platform(links' on my profile)...

I hope you like it, and if find it helpful/useful, kindly give a star and leave a follow. Thank you.

Would love to receive your feedback as well, so kindly reach out.
